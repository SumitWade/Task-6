# 🚀 Task 6 – Host a Static Website using GitHub Pages

This repository contains the solution for **Task 6** of the DevOps Internship Program. The primary goal was to demonstrate the ability to **host a static website using GitHub Pages** and share both the **repository** and the **live deployed link** as proof of completion.

## 🔥 Live Demo

✅ **GitHub Pages Link:** [https://github.com/SumitWade/Task-6.git/](https://github.com/SumitWade/Task-6.git)

## 📂 Project Structure

```
task-6-Github-pages/
├── README.md        # Documentation of the project
├── index.html       # The main HTML file (entry point for the website)
└── style.css        # The CSS file for styling
```

-----

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete the Task

### 1️⃣ Create Project Files

  - A simple static website was created with the following files:
      - **`index.html`** → Contains the structure and content.
      - **`style.css`** → Provides modern and clean UI styling.

### 2️⃣ Initialize Git Repository

  - The local repository was set up with a commit:
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit - Static site for GitHub Pages"
    ```

### 3️⃣ Push Code to GitHub

  - The local code was pushed to a new repository on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/SumitWade/Task-6.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```

### 4️⃣ Enable GitHub Pages

  - In the repository settings, GitHub Pages was enabled by navigating to **Settings** → **Pages**.
  - The `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder were selected as the source.

### 5️⃣ Verify Deployment

  - The live URL was opened to verify the website was publicly accessible and that HTTPS was enabled.
